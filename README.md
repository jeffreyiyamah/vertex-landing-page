## Overview

**Vertex** is the intelligence layer for incident response — a tool that turns raw CloudTrail logs into clear, human-readable incident timelines and root cause analyses.

This landing page introduces the product to early users and partners, showcasing what Vertex does, who it’s for, and how it helps security teams move from noise to narrative in seconds.

## What Vertex Solves

Security teams today are overloaded with raw logs and fragmented data. Vertex helps by:

- Automatically reconstructing timelines from AWS CloudTrail and related logs  
- Summarizing what happened, when, and why — in seconds  
- Reducing manual triage time for lean security and infra teams  
- Acting as a reasoning layer across noisy, disconnected security data
